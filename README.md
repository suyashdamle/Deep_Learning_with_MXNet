***

Following is the logical sequence of notebooks to try-out for beginners to the MXNet framework:


1. [Basic Training](/basic_training.ipynb)
2. [Experimentation with different initializations, batch normalization, optimizers & dropouts](/optimizers_dropout_initializations.ipynb)
3. [Transferring the abstract representations at hidden layers to learn logistic regressor model](/abstract_img_representations_using_trained_net.ipynb)
4. [CNN for Text Classification (using low-level Symbol API) & extended to use FastText embeddings](/Text_Classification_CNN.ipynb)
